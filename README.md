# Python1000-Practice-Activities
This free & open project contains additional activities for intermediate Python students, or students who have completed our "Python 1000" Training. Designed for accomplished beginners, students enrolled in our other Python training opportunities will also enjoy these activities.

Sadly, for some reason the ability to view what once were viewable as standard PDF files from GitHub recently stopped: no matter the browser, students can no longer see the first page of some of the requirement documents. 

Never to worry, our response was to include everything into a zip file. Better now it is to simply download NagysPythonPractice.zip. Moving forward, we will be updating that zip file each and every release. (GitHub's "clone or download" button may also continue work - yet who knows how random that might become in the future, as well?!)

Next, please note that these activities use UML Use Cases and Activity Diagrams.

If you need to learn more about how to create and read the core UML Diagram types, you can review our free on-line video on YouTube:

Also, if you would like to sign-up for Python 1000, Python 2000, or one of our advanced Python 3000 educational opportunities you can do so at https://www.udemy.com .


Enjoy!
